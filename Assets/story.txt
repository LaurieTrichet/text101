You wake up, it has been a very warm night and you struggled to sleep. You look outside the window, you see the grass is now brown, and your plants are heat stressed as well.

1) You watch the news
2) You water your plants in the backyard.

 It is 7am and it is 29 degrees outside. It has been the hotest month recorded so far.
